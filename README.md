# OzoneClickGUI
The clickgui used in my Minecraft Hacked Client, Ozone. Uses HeroCode Settings but can easily be migrated to another settings system.

# Please give me some credits, this took like 2 days to code and like 14 days of learning.
# Also credit HeroCode.

# Features
- Draggable
- Kinda customizeable

# Note this is my first clickgui so please if there are any issues (there probably are) tell me.
# Also watch out for my extremely messy code.
